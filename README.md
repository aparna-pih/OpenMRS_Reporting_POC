# OpenMRS_Reporting_POC
The goal of this poc is to check different options to automated data load from OpenMRS local dbs and back these up in cloud storage as parquet files. 
Then generate reports from the files and save them keeping the user interactions same. The POC uses Pandas for data load and report generation.
